## React to humidity

You could combine your humidity reading with a picture to also indicate the humidity in a graphical way. For example, you might display an ocean for high humidity, and a desert for low humidity:

At the bottom of your program, create more colour variables for any colours you want to use in your pictures. You may already have defined some of them in a previous step.

```python
o=(255,130,0)
b=(0,0,255)
c=(0,150,255)
e=(80,80,80)
g=(0,255,0)
y=(255,255,0)
```

Just like earlier, draw your pictures by first creating a list for each of them, and then setting the list items to the colours you want your pixels to be.

```python
wet = [
  b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b,
  b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b,
  b, o, b, o, o, o, b, b,
  b, o, o, o, o, e, o, b,
  b, o, o, o, o, o, o, b,
  b, o, b, o, o, o, b, b,
  b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b,
  b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b
]


dry = [
  c, c, g, g, c, c, c, c,
  c, c, g, g, c, g, c, c,
  g, c, g, g, c, g, c, c,
  g, c, g, g, c, g, c, c,
  g, g, g, g, g, g, c, c,
  c, c, g, g, c, c, c, c,
  y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y,
  y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y
]
```

Add some code to get the humidity:

```python
humid = sense.get_humidity()
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now decide which picture to display. For this example, we will display the `wet` image if the humidity reading is 40% or above, and the `dry` image if the humidity is below 40%.

```python
humid = sense.get_humidity()
if humid >= 40:
    sense.set_pixels(wet)
else:
    sense.set_pixels(dry)
```

Use the humidity slider to set a humidity on the emulator. Run your program and check that the image you've selected for that humidity is correctly displayed.

Change your code so that your program displays the humidity to the astronauts in your own chosen way.

--- /task ---

--- task --- Test your code with a few different humidity settings (using the slider) to make sure it always runs correctly. If you've followed the example above, is an image displayed both when the humidity is set to a value less than 40% and also when it is set to more than 40%?
