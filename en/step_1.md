## Introduction

Brighten up the daily routine of the astronauts on the International Space Station by showing them a message and the relative humidity on board using the new Mark II Astro Pi computer's Sense HAT.

The Mark II Astro Pi hardware is so new that the computers don’t even have names yet. We will name the Astro Pi computers after two inspirational European scientists. You can help choose what they’ll be called by voting for your favourite name as part of your Mission Zero program.

You will use the online Sense HAT emulator to create your program, so no extra hardware is needed — everything is done in a web browser.
*If it meets the eligibility criteria* your completed program will be run in space on the International Space Station (ISS)! You will also receive a special certificate that shows exactly where the ISS was when your program ran.

We will announce the chosen names for the new Astro Pi computers in spring 2022.


### What you will make

Here is an example of the kind of program you could make.

You will learn about the Astro Pi unit and how to control an it, including how to:
+ Display messages and colours
+ Create images
+ Measure the humidity using a Sense HAT

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

This activity can be completed in an afternoon. Organise your students into teams of one to four, and let us guide them through writing a short Python program to show a personal message and the relative humidity on the Astro Pi.

Read the [official guidelines document](https://astro-pi.org/media/mission-zero-guidelines/Astro_Pi_Mission_Zero_Guidelines_2021_22-en.pdf){:target="_blank"} for Mission Zero.

You will need to register for the Mission Zero challenge to allow your team(s) to participate.

+ Go to the [Trinket emulator Mission Zero page](https://trinket.io/mission-zero){:target="_blank"}.

+ Fill out the form and click **Submit**\*.

\* Please note that this registration form is available in English only.  

The fields on the form include:  
Teacher/mentor name   
Team name  
Number of team members  
Names and ages of team members  
In which language did you access the Mission Zero guidelines?

+ A Trinket account will be created for you (if you don't already have one, or you're not logged in). You can create one account per email address. Each account has its own **classroom code**, and you will need to tell your team(s) what yours is when they are ready to submit their programs.

+ Display your classroom code somewhere visible, for example on a whiteboard or using a projector, and begin the activity.

 We have created [a printable two-page handout](http://rpf.io/mz-printout){:target="_blank"} that covers the key points of Mission Zero and that students and young people can use together with this online project.
