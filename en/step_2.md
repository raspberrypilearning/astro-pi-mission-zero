## What is an Astro Pi?

An Astro Pi is a Raspberry Pi computer encased by a housing specially designed for conditions in space. It also has an add-on board called the Sense HAT, made specifically for the Astro Pi mission. The Sense HAT has a joystick, an LED display, and sensors for recording temperature, humidity, pressure, and orientation.

Here is a real Astro Pi unit on the International Space Station, running some code written by students. This is where your code will eventually be run!

For this mission, you will be using the Sense HAT emulator. The emulator is a piece of software which simulates all of the functions of the Astro Pi in your web browser.

There are a few differences between the real and the emulated Sense HAT:

- On the emulator, you can set the temperature, pressure, and humidity yourself using sliders, whereas the real Sense HAT in the Astro Pi uses sensors to measure these parameters in its environment.

- You can use the mouse to click and drag the emulated Sense HAT to move and rotate it, simulating changes in its orientation; the real Astro Pi (and its Sense HAT) can move in the real world, and the Sense HAT's orientation sensors detect when and how it has  moved.
