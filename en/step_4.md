## Sense a colour

In this step, you will set up the colour and brightness sensor. You will use this sensor to measure the amount of red, green, and blue light reaching the sensor. These values will then be used to change one of the colours in your chosen image.

This means that the image can change depending on what the sensor sees. For example, an astronaut wearing a blue shirt would see a different version of the image from an astronaut wearing a red shirt.

In the whale image we used in the previous step, the background colour was black. We used the variable `c` to store its RGB colour code:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 1
---
c = (0, 0, 0)

--- /code ---


--- task ---

Use the colour sensor to change one of your colours.

Underneath the lines where you define the colours, add the following code:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 3, 4
---
# Sense a colour
rgb = sense.color # get the colour from the sensor
c = (rgb.red, rgb.green, rgb.blue) # use the sensed colour

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

This code replaces the RGB values stored in `c` with the values for the colour detected by the sensor.

Tip: If you didn't use the variable `c` in your own image, replace `c` with one of the colour variables that you did use. This will allow the sensor to change that colour instead.

--- task ---

**Test:** Move the colour slider to a colour of your choice and then **run** your code. Your background colour will change. Repeat this test again with a new colour.

**Tip:** You will need to click 'Run' every time you change the colour.

Now you have displayed an image and sensed a colour and used it in your program, and your code is ready for submission! 

You can save and submit your program using the form at the bottom of the code editor.
  
However, you may wish to add more images to your project, or make it come to life with animation. The next steps show you how to do this.
</p>

## Animate your project (optional)

Your Mission Zero program can run on the International Space Station (ISS) for up to 30 seconds. You can use this running time to display an animation on the LED matrix by switching between two or more different images.

--- task ---


**Add** a second image right below your `sense.set_pixels(image)` line of code. Give it the variable name `image2` and change a few pixels to make your animation frame look different. Then add a short pause after it.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: false
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

image = [
c, g, c, g, c, c, c, c,
c, c, g, c, c, f, f, f,

sense.set_pixels(image)

# Extra images / frames go here:

image2 = [
c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c,
c, c, c, c, c, f, f, f,
c, f, f, f, c, c, f, c,

g, g, g, g, g, g, c, c,
c, g, g, g, g, c, c, c]

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

At the very bottom of your code file, set up your `for` loop to repeat `14` times and alternate between displaying `image` and `image2` pausing for 1 second on each frame.

**Tip:** Make sure the lines of code underneath `for i in range(14):` are indented with a space so they sit **inside** the loop block.

filename: main.py

g, f, f, f, f, f, f, c,
g, g, g, g, g, g, c, c,
c, g, g, g, g, c, c, c]

sleep(1)

# Loop 14 times (14 * 2 seconds = 28 seconds total animation)
for i in range(14):
  # Display the second image
  sense.set_pixels(image2)
  sleep(1)

  # Display the first image
  sense.set_pixels(image)
  sleep(1)
  
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code again. Your program will display your sensed color instantly, and then loop back and forth for an animated display.

--- /task ---

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
If you would like to have more than two frames in your animation, you must make sure that the program will run for no more than 30 seconds. For example, if you have 10 images that each display for 1 second, you must change your `for` loop to repeat 3 times (10 * 3 = 30 seconds)
</p>

--- task ---

**Check for errors**

My code has a syntax error or doesn't change frames:
- Check that your `for` loop code matches the indentation in the example.
- Make sure you named your second image matrix `image2` and that it is placed outside and before the loop begins.
- Check that your `sleep` times are set to exactly `1` second to avoid running past the strict 30-second execution cutoff on the ISS.

**Save your progress**

You can save your program on the Mission Starter project by entering your team name, team members' names, and the classroom code given to you. You can reload your program on any device with an internet connection by entering your team name and classroom code.
