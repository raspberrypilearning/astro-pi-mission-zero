## Submit your entry

Please note: Mission Zero is now closed for the 2021/22 season. You can still complete the activity but won’t be able to submit it. The next Challenge will launch in Autumn 2022

There are a few rules your code needs to follow so that you can submit it to be run on the International Space Station. If your code follows them, the rules at the bottom of the [Sense HAT emulator](https://trinket.io/mission-zero) will light up in green when you run the program.

1. Take a humidity reading.
1. Light up the LEDs.
1. Ensure your code runs all the way to the end without any errors occurring. You should not include any `while True` loops in your code as this will keep you code running and prevent it from finishing.
1. Test your code with a few different humidity settings (using the slider) to make sure it will always run correctly. 

Also make sure you have met the following criteria:

1. Make sure your message to the astronauts runs for no longer than 30 seconds, as this is how long your code will run for on the ISS
1. Avoid using any methods needing input
1. Only import from the `sense_hat`, `time`, and `random` modules
1. Make sure you don't include any profanity

Once the rules are all green, you are ready to submit.
