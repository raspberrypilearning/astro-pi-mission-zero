## What next â€” more Astro Pi projects

Now that you have completed your mission, why not try out some more projects using the other sensors on the Astro Pi?

If you're feeling confident, you could take part in [Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/missions/space-lab/)! Form a team of two to six people, and work together like real space scientists to design your own experiment. The best ideas submitted will receive an Astro Pi kit to use to help with your mission.

Alternatively you might want to try out one of our other Sense HAT projects:

+ Learn [more about the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat){:target="_blank"} and the other things it can do

+ Create some pretty [random sparkles](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-random-sparkles){:target="_blank"} on the Sense HAT's LED display

+ Create a [Flappy Astronaut](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/flappy-astronaut){:target="_blank"} game

+ Challenge your friends with a [marble maze](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-marble-maze){:target="_blank"} game

+ Recreate the classic game of [Pong](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-pong){:target="_blank"}
