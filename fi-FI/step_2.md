Astro Pi computers come with a set of sensors and gadgets that can be used to run great scientific experiments. This set of sensors is called a ‘Sense HAT’ (that stands for ‘Hardware Attached on Top’). The Sense HAT gives Astro Pi the ability to ‘sense’ and make many kinds of measurements, from temperature to movement, and to output information using an 8 x 8 LED matrix display. The Astro Pis also have a joystick and buttons, just like a video game console!
