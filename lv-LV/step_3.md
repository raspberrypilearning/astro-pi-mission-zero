## Display an image

The image you display will be made from 64 coloured squares called **pixels**. The pixels are arranged in an 8 x 8 grid. Each pixel can be a different colour. By choosing the colours carefully, you can create a picture. Here is an example of a whale made using different shades of blue on a black background.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
An <span style="color: #0faeb0">**LED matrix**</span> is a grid of LEDs that can be controlled individually or as a group to create different lighting effects. The LED matrix on the Sense HAT has 64 LEDs displayed in an 8 x 8 grid. The LEDs can be programmed to produce a wide range of colours.
</p>

Notice that each square is labelled with a code to represent a particular colour. In this image 3 colours are used:
+ c = black
+ f = Ocean blue
+ g = Sky blue

Open the [Mission Zero starter project](https://missions.astro-pi.org/mz/code_submissions/){:target="_blank"}.

You will see that a few lines of code have been added for you automatically.

This code connects to the Astro Pi, makes sure the Astro Pi's LED display is shown the correct way around and sets up the colour sensor. Leave the code there, because you'll need it.

### RGB Colours

Colours can be created using different proportions of red, green, and blue. You can find out about RGB colours here:

![Three sliders demonstrating RGB colour values](images/rgbsliders.gif)

The LED matrix is an 8 x 8 grid. Each LED on the grid can be set to a different colour. We can use the letters a to z as the names of variables to represent 24 different colours. Each colour has a value for red, green, and blue.

### Choose an image

--- task ---

**Choose:** Pick an image to display from the options below. Python stores the information for an image in a list. The code for each image includes the colour variables used and the list.

You will need to **copy** all of the code for your chosen image then **paste** it into your project below the line which says `# Add colour variables and image`.

**Debug**

My code has a syntax error:

- Check that your code matches the code in the examples above
- Check that you have indented the code in your list
- Check that your list is surrounded by `[` and `]`
- Check that each colour variable in the list is separated by a comma

My image does not appear:

- Check that your `sense.set_pixels(image)` is not indented
