You can now enter the [Astro Pi Mission Zero](https://astro-pi.org/vls/mission-zero){:target="_blank"} challenge, using the code you have written.

If you’re feeling confident, you could take part in Mission Space Lab. Form a team of two to six people, and work together to answer a real scientific question. All teams that submit an eligible program will be invited to a virtual Q&A with an ESA astronaut at the end of the Astro Pi Challenge cycle.

Alternatively you might want to try out one of our other Sense HAT projects:
